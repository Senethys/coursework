1.  Previous feedback claimed that an mwe was abset, which is not the case.
    It was called Alarm.java (as required) and is mentioned in comments that 
    it is an mwe. Clarified some example steps with print statements.

2.  Added headers (date, name, course info etc...)and 
    comments to missing tests and class functions.
    Changed everything to English. 

3.  Rewrote so that getters don't change attritubte states get (isTriggered)
    in AlarmClock.java previously changed attribute "status" after
    it returned true.

4.  Added correct compile instructions.

5.  Added tags. (@throws, @return, @param)

6.  Added execution flow in report.

7.  Added javadoc.

8.  Refactored testcodes with only one assertion instead of mostly two.
    Functions with two assertions were split into two functions. 
    The new functions have new names where the last capitalized word of
    funktion name indicates what functions is being tested.

9.  Made all tests deemed "too long" shorter and divided into smaller unit tests.
